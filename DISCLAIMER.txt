WARNING!!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! NO GUARANTIES IF ANYTHING GETS BROKEN.
DO NOT COPY ANYTHING EXCEPT PYTHON CODE YOU HAVE REVIEWED!!
FOR EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

This app executes Python code after it is copied in clipboard.
It saves the contents of the clipboard in file "testscript.py" and executes it.
It ONLY executes content which is different from previously copied contents.
The CopyRun app waits for the launched code to exit and then continues to work.
At all times there should be a warning window visible, which indicates
that this app is active and running. It also writes status messages in terminal.

This warning is a part of CopyRun app and should be included in code at all times!
